            <p>Hotcoin employs two-factor authentication to add an extra layer of security. Users must verify their identity through a secondary device, making unauthorized access significantly more difficult.</p>
            <h3>Cold Storage</h3>
            <p>A majority of Hotcoin's assets are stored in cold storage, which is offline and inaccessible to hackers. This ensures that even in the event of a breach, the bulk of the assets remain secure.</p>
            <h3>Encryption</h3>
            <p>Hotcoin uses advanced encryption protocols to protect user data and transactions. This ensures that sensitive information is kept confidential and secure from potential threats.</p>
